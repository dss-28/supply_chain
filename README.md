# AI for Supply Chain Optimization 🚚📦🌾

## 📌 Overview
This project explores how AI/ML can optimize supply chain workflows — focusing on **demand forecasting, inventory optimization, and route optimization**.  
The design is **domain-agnostic** (works for agriculture, retail, or logistics) and modular, so each part can be extended independently.

## 🎯 Goals
- Predict demand at each location for the next time period.
- Optimize inventory levels to reduce holding cost and avoid stockouts.
- (Future) Optimize delivery routes to minimize time and cost.

## 🧩 Modules

### 1. Demand Forecasting
- **Objective**: Predict product/crop demand at each location for the next period.  
- **Data**:  
  - Kaggle retail sales, agriculture crop yield, or supply chain datasets  
  - Columns: Product, Location, Date, Sales/Quantity, optional external factors (weather, promotions)  
- **Features**:  
  - Lag features, rolling averages, seasonal indicators  
- **Models**:  
  - Baseline: ARIMA, Prophet  
  - Advanced: LSTM, GRU  
- **Evaluation**: MAE, RMSE, MAPE  
- **Visualization**: Actual vs predicted demand, error plots

### 2. Inventory Optimization
- **Objective**: Minimize costs by balancing holding vs shortage.  
- **Formulation**:  
  - Decision variable: reorder quantity per product/location  
  - Objective: Minimize (holding + shortage costs)  
  - Constraints: warehouse capacity, lead time, minimum stock  
- **Solution**:  
  - Linear Programming (PuLP, OR-Tools)  
- **Visualization**:  
  - Warehouse heatmaps  
  - Cost savings before/after optimization  
  - Interactive scenario simulation

### 3. Route Optimization (Planned)
- **Objective**: Efficient delivery route planning  
- **Methods**:  
  - TSP/VRP algorithms  
  - Compare current vs optimized routes (time, cost)  
- **Visualization**:  
  - Interactive route maps  

---

## 📊 Outcome
- Functional prototype with three core modules  
- Modular design → scalable to agriculture, retail, logistics  
- Recruiter/senior-ready demo with visual impact (charts, maps, dashboards)
