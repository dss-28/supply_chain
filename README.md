Optimize supply chains with **AI/ML-driven demand forecasting, inventory optimization, and route planning**.
The framework is **domain-agnostic** — adaptable to **agriculture, retail, or logistics**.

---

## 📌 Overview

Supply chains are complex and costly. This project develops an **AI-powered toolkit** to:

* 📈 Forecast demand at each location
* 🏪 Optimize inventory to cut costs & avoid shortages
* 🚚 Plan efficient delivery routes (planned)

---

## 🎯 Goals

* 🔮 Predict demand at each location for the next period
* 📦 Balance holding vs shortage to minimize costs
* 🛣️ Optimize routes to reduce delivery time & cost (future)

---

## 🧩 Modules

### 1️⃣ Demand Forecasting

* **Objective**: Predict product/crop demand per location
* **Data Sources**: Kaggle retail sales, agriculture yield, logistics datasets
* **Features**: Lag features, rolling averages, seasonal indicators
* **Models**:

  * Baseline: **ARIMA, Prophet**
  * Advanced: **LSTM, GRU**
* **Evaluation**: MAE, RMSE, MAPE
* **Visualization**: 📊 Actual vs Predicted plots

---

### 2️⃣ Inventory Optimization

* **Objective**: Minimize cost by balancing holding & shortage
* **Formulation**:

  * Decision variable → reorder quantity
  * Objective → Minimize (holding + shortage)
  * Constraints → warehouse capacity, lead time, minimum stock
* **Solution**: Linear Programming (**PuLP, OR-Tools**)
* **Visualization**:

  * 🗂️ Warehouse heatmaps
  * 💰 Cost savings comparison
  * 🔄 Scenario simulations

---

### 3️⃣ Route Optimization (Planned)

* **Objective**: Efficient delivery planning
* **Methods**: TSP / VRP algorithms
* **Visualization**: 🗺️ Interactive route maps (before vs optimized)

---

## 📊 Outcome

* ✅ Demand forecasting & inventory optimization modules
* 🔧 Modular design → scalable across **agriculture, retail, logistics**
* 📈 Visual outputs → charts, maps, dashboards → recruiter/senior demo-ready

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

* **Backend**: Python (Pandas, Numpy, Scipy)
* **ML/DL**: ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM, GRU
* **Optimization**: PuLP, OR-Tools
* **Visualization/Dashboards**: Matplotlib, Plotly, Streamlit

---

## 🚧 Current Status

* ✅ Documentation prepared
* 🚧 Implementation in progress
* 🎯 Next → Build demand forecasting prototype on Kaggle datasets
